Command (Form Backing) Object
Spring uses the notion of a command object, which essentially is a JavaBean style class
that gets populated with the data from an HTML formâ€™s fields.This same object is also
passed to our validators (discussed next) for data validation, and if the validations pass, it
is passed to the onSubmit method (in controller related classes) for processing of valid
data.
